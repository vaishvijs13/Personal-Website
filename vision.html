    <h1 id="VisionHeading">My Vision</h1>
    <div id=Vision><p id="VisionText">Hello! I'm Vaishvi Shah, a twelfth grade student studying at Henry Wise Wood High School in Calgary, Alberta.
    Since an early age, I have been passionate for subjects in STEM, ranging from complex problems in math to interactive labs in physics.
    Initially, my appeal for STEM encouraged me to challenge myself through honours courses offered at school. However, seeing as my passion
    was not fulfilled by solely relying on the school curriculum, I found myself engaging in a multitude of extracurriculars, where I hold various
    positions that have advanced a broad range of my skillset. My interests primarily lie in computer science, physics, and mathematics. I began programming in the fourth grade
    and found an inexorable passion in it since. I have created many projects, both software and hardware based, in order to learn more about
    the subject and spend time doing what I enjoy! After exploring programming and hardware, I found an appeal in the progression of the field of technology; my aspiration is 
    to add innovation in computer science by enhancing human-computer interactions. My knowledge in AR/VR, haptics, and robotics, have led to pursue 
    different projects that can improve these disciplines and offer novelty to the industry of technology.</p>
    <p id="VisionText2">As well, part of my vision for the future is crafted by the following quote:
    <p id="Quote"><em>Education is the most powerful weapon whice you can use to change the world" - Nelson Mandela.</em></p>
    <p id="VisionText3">Since a young age, I have recognized the disparity in education resources between developed and developing communities, leading me to take many efforts to minimize this gap and provide accessible education.
        My vision, based on a hope for a better future, has encouraged me to found an international non-profit in the ninth grade. 
        Known as STEMatic Leaders, we hope to present various accessible STEM opportunities to students across the world.</p></div>
