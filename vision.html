    <div id=Vision><p id="VisionText">Hello! I'm Vaishvi Shah, a twelfth grade student studying at Henry Wise Wood High School in Calgary, Alberta.
    Since an early age, I have been passionate for subjects in STEM, ranging from complex problems in computer science to interactive labs in physics.
    Initially, my appeal for STEM encouraged me to challenge myself through honours courses offered at school. However, seeing as my passion
    was not fulfilled by solely relying on the school curriculum, I found myself engaging in a multitude of extracurriculars and self-directed learning, through online university courses, both of which 
    have advanced a broad range of my skillset. My interests primarily lie in computer science, physics, and mathematics. I began programming in the fourth grade
    and found an inexorable passion in it ever since. My curiosity and appeal for programming has driven me to pursue a career in the field; after writing my first line of code, 
    I explored different programming languages, conducted self-directed learning, and created several projects, both software and hardware based, to learn more about the subject and spend time doing what I enjoy.
    <br><br>As I explored technology through different projects and roles, I found an appeal in progressing the industry; my aspiration is to add innovation in computer science by enhancing human-computer interactions. Technology has innumerable applications
    in industries across the world, which is why I find immense value in advancing the field by building new programming frameworks or devices as well as improving the efficacy of existing ones. My knowledge in AR/VR, haptics, and robotics has led me to pursue 
    projects that can improve these disciplines and offer novelty to the industry of technology. My fascination with the interdisciplinary world of computer science encourages me to search for and participate in opportunities that can help me grow and learn.
    Alongside passion projects, I am expanding my knowledge in the field through various positions, ranging from leadership roles to internship and research positions.
    I am a teamplayer who values critical-thinking, dedication, and collaboration and hopes to bring those skills along with my technical ones to any role I possess.<br><br>As well, part of my vision for the future is crafted by the following quote:</p>
    <p id="Quote"><em>Education is the most powerful weapon whice you can use to change the world" - Nelson Mandela.</em></p>
    <p id="VisionText3">Since a young age, I have recognized the disparity in education resources between developed and developing communities, leading me to take many efforts to minimize this gap and provide accessible education.
        My vision, based on a hope for a better future, encouraged me to found an international non-profit in the ninth grade. 
        Known as STEMatic Leaders, we hope to present various accessible STEM opportunities to students across the world. I hope to continue hosting competitions, workshops, olympiads, and webinars as the signficance of opportunities and education cannot be emphasized enough.</p></div>
