    <p id="PortfolioText2"><b>HapticLever: 2021-Present</b><br>As a research intern at a research lab in the University of Calgary, I collaborated with a Master's Student to create the HapticLever. It is a mechanical arm that allows individuals to feel large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments. This project included electrical and hardware components (ie. arduino building and coding), programming with VR frameworks (Python, HTML, C#), and mechanical design. Take a look at a picture of the HapticLever above!</p>

    <p id="PortfolioText2"><b>FIRST Robotics Team 2023 Robot: 2022-2023</b><br>After being posed with the FIRST robotics challenge in 2023, my team created a robot to successfully pass the two regional competitions we had the opportunity to attend. As a part of the software team, I used Java to program the robot for the autonomous and drive period of the tournament. I also worked on Fusion 360 CAD to implement prototypes and test mechanical designs of the robot. The above picture shows the robot my team, Forge Robotics (#4421) presented during the 2023 season.</p>

    <p id="PortfolioText2"><b>Youreka Calgary Project: 2022</b><br>Youreka Calgary provided my high school research team with a prompt: Create a research project that tackles the topic of vaccinations. We analyzed influenza vaccine effectiveness across different age groups, using data analysis. Through R programming, we conducted ANOVAs, Tukey HSD, and T-tests to understand the significance of our chosen dataset. Our presented manuscript and research poster helped us in receiving 2nd place in Calgary's symposium. We also had the opportunity to advance to nationals! Our research paper is currently in the publication project for the Journal of Emerging Investigators.</p>

        <p id="PortfolioText2"><b>CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript: 2021</b><br>I completed CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (edX course presented by Harvard University) in 2021. An example of a project I created for this course is a replica of Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search. The style and functions exactly replicate Google. HTML and CSS were primarily used for this project, which is published on my github!</p>
